  <div class="post-content"><p>In autumn 2019 I started thinking about different product ideas and noticed all talk and no walk will not get me anywhere.</p>
<p>That is when I started learning about building products and how to actually create things for the web. I started out learning as much as I can about all kinds of things like NoCode Tools, UX, UI, read books and enrolled in all kinds of online classes, communites, forums, subreddits and, of course, Youtube rabbit holes.</p>
<p>It was during one of my Youtube Coding / Lifesytle Blogger rabbit hole loops where the Youtuber and programmer with the name of 
 <a href="https://youtube.com/aaronjack" target="_blank">Aaron Jack</a>  mentioned Pieter Levels.</p>
<p>After I watched his video on how to start a startup and hearing his bold approach towards creating things I was really motivated.</p>
<p><em>&quot; The biggest thing in coding and in business is to <strong>learn how to lean</strong> and to learn <strong>how to figure things out for yourself</strong> &ldquo;</em> - Pieter Levels</p>
<p>It was then in the Summer of 2020 where I discovered the online community indie hackers and I was blown away.</p>
<p>A whole community of people trying to achieve exactly what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>So many groups and people discussing topics I was loosely trying to put together in my asana to do list.</p>
<p>Especially the No Code Movement grabbed my attention as I know basic web developmemnt concepts, but can not code whole products of my own.</p>
<p>I loved the way in which information got shared and everyone supported each other.</p>
<p>After working with all kind of No Code tools I came to one realization:</p>
<p><strong>I want to have a better understanding of whats happening under the hood.</strong></p>
<p>No Code is great and todays platforms are always getting even better, but at some point I saw features where I knew &ldquo;this is one line of html&rdquo; and I had to pay 5$ extra just to activate the feature.</p>
<p>This is when I made the decision I do not want to be dependent on tools, but rather have the freedom of building on my own terms.</p>
<p>And this is where I am right now.</p>
<p>I am still in the process of learning coding concepts but also using No Code tools to be fast with certain things.</p>
<p>My goal is to create and learn as much as possible in 2021.</p>
