      <description>Greetings, my friend from the world wide web.
This website is the result of me failing at publishing online on a regular basis.
I often faced many struggles with (old) new publishing technologies, which got in my way of just writing and publishing.
That is why I have re-thought the way in which I bring things online.
This website makes it easy to just write &amp;amp; publish.
No bloated add ons, ads, extension or other things that get in your and my way.</description>
