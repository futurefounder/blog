      <description>Estimated Reading Time: 2 Mins
Alright, folks, we are right back at the start again.
This time for round #3 of the Micro Startup Journey.
I&amp;rsquo;ve launched my first 2 Micro Startups in January and February and have taken the first days of March to reflect on what I have learned so far.
Time to launch
One main thing that struck me is - I launched both on nearly the same day of the month.</description>

      <description>In 2010 I stepped into the doors of an advertising agency for my first junior full-time position and I was sparkling full of energy and enthusiasm.
&amp;ldquo;Work Hard Play Hard&amp;rdquo;
I lived and breathed the mantra for the next 7 years. I was working an unhealthy amount of hours, neglected my friends and family, fueled by the idealistic view that the next title and promotion will finally bring me happiness and justify the unpaid over hours.</description>

      <description>Finally started working on my February Micro Startup.
After being done scratching my own itch, market research, audience analysis and talking to people from my audience in IRL over the last 2 weeks I wrote the first lines of code for 🌱📚❤️ VeganBookBase.com.
I am currently running through hundreds of Vegan Books, so every minute is valuable.
As my priority is to learn on the go, I am not using a Website Builder on the main page.</description>

      <description>In autumn 2019 I started thinking about different product ideas and noticed all talk and no walk will not get me anywhere.
That is when I started learning about building products and how to actually create things for the web. I started out learning as much as I can about all kinds of things like NoCode Tools, UX, UI, read books and enrolled in all kinds of online classes, communites, forums, subreddits and, of course, Youtube rabbit holes.</description>

      <description>Note: The initial version was sent out to my newsletter recipients on the 31std of January 2021. This version has some slight adjustements.
Welcome to the first issue of 🚀 One Micro Startup Per Month
The last weeks have been quite an adventurous ride for me.
On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.
Yeah, a real one.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.</description>
