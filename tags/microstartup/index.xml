So today I will be diving into my problems, my audience and product ideas.
I am noticing I need guidance and a framework again. Like in time constraints and rules I will work by.
So I guess I will try to set my time today to 4 hours focused work on my startup.
Why &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; 4 hours ?
Because I read in Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s Book &amp;ldquo;Deep Work&amp;rdquo; 4 hours being the optimal time you can work with full concentration on something.</description>

Alright, folks, we are right back at the start again.
This time for round #3 of the Micro Startup Journey.
I&amp;rsquo;ve launched my first 2 Micro Startups in January and February and have taken the first days of March to reflect on what I have learned so far.
Time to launch
One main thing that struck me is - I launched both on nearly the same day of the month.</description>

      <description>Finally started working on my February Micro Startup.
After being done scratching my own itch, market research, audience analysis and talking to people from my audience in IRL over the last 2 weeks I wrote the first lines of code for 🌱📚❤️ VeganBookBase.com.
I am currently running through hundreds of Vegan Books, so every minute is valuable.
As my priority is to learn on the go, I am not using a Website Builder on the main page.</description>

      <description>Note: The initial version was sent out to my newsletter recipients on the 31std of January 2021. This version has some slight adjustements.
Welcome to the first issue of 🚀 One Micro Startup Per Month
The last weeks have been quite an adventurous ride for me.
On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.
Yeah, a real one.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.</description>
