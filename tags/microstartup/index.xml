      <description>Finally started working on my February Micro Startup.
After being done scratching my own itch, market research, audience analysis and talking to people from my audience in IRL over the last 2 weeks I wrote the first lines of code for 🌱📚❤️ VeganBookBase.com.
Took me 3 Minutes to create the coming soon page in carrd and I am currently running through hundreds of Vegan Books, so every minute is valuable.</description>

      <description>Note: The initial version was sent out to my newsletter recipients on the 31std of January 2021. This version has some slight adjustements.
Welcome to the first issue of 🚀 One Micro Startup Per Month
The last weeks have been quite an adventurous ride for me.
On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.
Yeah, a real one.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.</description>
