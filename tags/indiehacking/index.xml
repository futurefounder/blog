      <description>Finally started working on my February Micro Startup.
After being done scratching my own itch, market research, audience analysis and talking to people from my audience in IRL over the last 2 weeks I wrote the first lines of code for 🌱📚❤️ VeganBookBase.com.
Took me 3 Minutes and I am currently running through hundreds of Vegan Books, so every minute is valuable.
As my priority is to learn on the go, I am not using a Website Builder on the main page.</description>

      <description>In autumn 2019 I started thinking about different product ideas and noticed all talk and no walk will not get me anywhere.
That is when I started learning about building products and how to actually create things for the web. I started out learning as much as I can about all kinds of things like NoCode Tools, UX, UI, read books and enrolled in all kinds of online classes, communites, forums, subreddits and, of course, Youtube rabbit holes.</description>
