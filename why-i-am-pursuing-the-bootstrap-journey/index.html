  <div class="post-content"><p>In 2010 I stepped into the doors of an advertising agency for my first junior full-time position and I was sparkling full of energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Work Hard Play Hard&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/cw9kNrY/clock-s.gif" alt="Man running around clock"></p>
<p>I lived and breathed the mantra for the next 7 years. I was working an unhealthy amount of hours, neglected my friends and family, fueled by the idealistic view that the next title and promotion will finally bring me happiness and justify the unpaid over hours.</p>
<p>Coming from a world of competitive sports I had learned that hard training pays off.</p>
<p>I thought I can transfer my mentality to my professional life.</p>
<p>But it did not work that way.</p>
<p><strong>The wall cracked</strong></p>
<p>It was then when my view on the professional world started to crack.</p>
<p>I was fixated on my next promotion as my boss told me &ldquo;Promotions are in within fixed time-frames. It&rsquo;s the way it is here&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I was shocked and felt betrayed.</p>
<p>Nobody told me, I have no influence on the timing of the promotion beforehand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or you can simply fake-resign and try to get your promotion that way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But I had fun working with my team. Why should I risk this?</p>
<p>Playing the game of politics combined with an unbalanced work-life ratio was not sustainable for me.</p>
<p><strong>The search for meaning</strong></p>
<p>I pursued different marketing roles for the next years and am really grateful for having the opportunity to work for small local businesses to silicon valley VC-funded companies.</p>
<p>It usually took about a year until my inner voice kept on telling me</p>
<p><em>Something fundamental is missing.</em></p>
<p>That is why I decided to take over the steering wheel and take a ride onto a new journey.</p>
<p><strong>Re-adjustment</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WxD5N6r/car-s.gif" alt="car sunset"></p>
<p>During the summer of 2020 I&rsquo;ve stepped back mentally and adopted the learners mindset.</p>
<p>Coming from a world of strategy and consulting on paid marketing campaigns for rather big companies I had the feeling I lack fundamental practical skills.</p>
<p>I knew how to make a shiny power-point convincing you with strange sounding words where and when to spend your advertising dollars.</p>
<p>But I had no idea how these websites were actually working under the hood. Or how to create things online that people like.</p>
<p>That is when I started to learn and read a lot and join online communities.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://blog.futurefounder.me/path-into-indie-hacking/">discovered the indie hacking scene through online videos</a> and realized it is possible to design my life as I want it - with genuine freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Stepping into the unknown</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Qb5rJnc/test.gif" alt="Printer Test Pages"></p>
<p>Since January 2021 I started my bootstrap experiment by creating one micro-startup every month. I am still learning a lot like how to come up with ideas, how to talk to potential clients, and how to actually build stuff with code or no-code.</p>
<p>I have created 2 micro startups so far and have loved the journey so far.</p>
<p>I am starting to realize my preferred style of working and have created habits that keep me productive.</p>
<p>I do not know where this journey will take me, but I am willing to steer through the unknown with a sense of purpose and clarity.</p>
<p>I am currently thinking about which project to launch next.</p>
