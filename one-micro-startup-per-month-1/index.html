Welcome to the first issue of 🚀 One Micro Startup Per Month
The last weeks have been quite an adventurous ride for me.
On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.
Yeah, a real one.
Didn&rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.">

<p>Welcome to the first issue of 🚀 <strong>One Micro Startup Per Month</strong></p>
<p>The last weeks have been quite an adventurous ride for me.</p>
<p>On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.<br>
Yeah, a real one.<br>
Didn&rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.<br>
No Electricity.<br>
No Wifi.<br>
Nice.<br>
But, I&rsquo;ll get to that in a bit.</p>
<p>Let us start with the question of</p>
<p><strong>🤷 Why am I actually doing this stuff?</strong></p>
<p>After having made the decision to start my own, independent journey, the obvious burning urge to find a super-cool, big idea, which will instantly propel me to the fruitful freedom land of successful founders hang over me.</p>
<p>In late 2019 I started working on all kinds of side projects from a blog, to editing Youtube videos and getting back into learning about coding.</p>
<p>It was then when I discovered <a href="https://levels.io">Pieter Levels</a> who had a rather bold approach towards founding a startup.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;<em>12 startups in 12 months</em>&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Mind.<br>
Blown.<br>
🤯</p>
<p>Instead of starting one major big thing he would rather start 12.</p>
<p>Reading this I felt a relief as this approach takes out pressure from finding<br>
&ldquo;<em>the one and only</em>&rdquo; idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand this approach also means a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>As finding, validating and launching one start up per month over 12 months is an ambitious goal.</p>
<p>But, this system had one major benefit in my eyes:<br>
I can try and learn a lot in a very short time.<br>
And that was and is one of my main driving forces.</p>
<p><strong>Learning and growing.</strong></p>
<p><em>Fun fact: Pieter Levels never even finished his 12 startups project. His 5th startup nomadlist was so successful that he went full time on it</em></p>
<p>The next burning questions is obviously:</p>
<p><strong>💡 How do I come up with Ideas?</strong></p>
<p>Equipped with the knowledge that I can start and launch different projects on the go, I headed towards my first small projects.</p>
<p>🏃🏽‍♂️💨</p>
<p>I started out with personal projects and noticed I need deadlines and accountability.</p>
<p>That is why I enrolled in start up focused schools and communities.</p>
<p>I read and learned about all kind of different techniques and methods to find start up ideas.</p>
<p>I was struck when I came across this quote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It&rsquo;s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.</em>&rdquo; Paul Graham from YCombinator</p>
<p><em>Note: YCombinator is an american Startup Accelerator known for Airbnb, Reddit, Twitch, Dropbox and more.</em></p>
<p>OK, starting a startup based on my own problems? Where should I start? 😅</p>
<p>After going through many problems and potential ideas I was drawn towards an issue I had with my team at the office.
I always had the belief, that technology has the potential to help humans - if used wisely ☝️</p>
<p>That is why I decided to tackle our problem at the office with technology.
The problem we faced was:</p>
<p><em>More remote work meant less to no a social connection in our team.</em></p>
<p>No chit-chat over the desk.<br>
No water cooler talks.<br>
No lunch talks.</p>
<p>So I started out by thinking of ways how to overcome this.</p>
<p>I always talked to my team members about what they would like to do.</p>
<p>I came up with a slack app called &ldquo;Random Coffee&rdquo; which easily matched team members each week for a coffee chat.</p>
<p>In addition, I knew one of our team members is a yoga instructor, so I encouraged her to do a remote yoga class once per week with us.</p>
<p>Each week I talked to the team about what they liked and what not and wrote all new things into a list.</p>
<p>But, are we the only ones with this problems?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look into</p>
<p><strong>📌 Problem Validation</strong></p>
<p>After talking to many ex-colleagues, friends and people over the internet I always got the same feedback - same problem, nice list.</p>
<p>Especially people working in People&rsquo;s Management and HR were having these issues come up.</p>
<p>Now, that I knew this is a problem for a lot of people it&rsquo;s time to bring the project out into the world with a</p>
<p><strong>🚀 Launch</strong></p>
<p>I built a dynamic list on a webservice that has a lot of nice functionalities like adding pictures and creating sort able cards.</p>
<p>I then created a website with further information about the topic and kept on talking to people from other companies.</p>
<p>With each interview I got to know more about what is important to which kind of businesses.</p>
<p>That was the basis for the language and benefits I communicated on my website.</p>
<p>Now to the power cut - sorry for the long preface 😁</p>
<p>For the launches of my product I will mainly choose Product Hunt.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This is the main website for tech enthusiasts, startup founders and venture capital firms to discover new tech related things.</p>
<p>I prepared all material, scheduled my launch and went to sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning I made my last checks and literally 15 mins after my launch - zoooooom</p>
<p>😐</p>
<p>All lights out.<br>
Nothing working.<br>
I was shocked.</p>
<p>On the launch day I had to be prepared to answer questions, react to problems or topics on social media.</p>
<p>So I created a wifi hotspot, did the last minor things on my laptop before the battery went flat and had to juggle on my smartphone for the next hours.</p>
<p>After about 5 hrs. electricity a small <em>bip bip</em> from the wifi router came up.</p>
<p>🤩</p>
<p>Back. On. Track.<br>
Nice.</p>
<p>I was able to get back to fixing issues on the site and answering topics from the comfort of my laptop.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s next?</strong></p>
<p>Right now I am analyzing and talking to potential business opportunities that came up after the launch.</p>
<p>The first ride was stressful, but fun 🥳</p>
<p>I really learned a lot about how to talk to customers and finding things that are of value.</p>
<p>AH, just in case: I think you already know my project, if not you can have a look at</p>
<p><a href="http://virtualteamactivitieslist.com">virtualteamactivitieslist.com</a></p>
<p>or not 😁</p>
<p>Now is the time to rinse the mind and repeat.</p>
