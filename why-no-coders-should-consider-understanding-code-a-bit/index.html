<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/X5JpwVB/nocode-frame.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/X5JpwVB/nocode-frame.png"></p>
<p>Google Trends &ldquo;<strong>nocode</strong>&rdquo; search term over the last 4 years setting higher lows showing an upward momentum trend. Especially over the past year.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably got along with your favorite no-code tool and know how to create websites or dynamic online lists without writing a line of code.</p>
<p>Which is amazing if we make a step back mentally and think back a decade or two.</p>
<p><strong>Past: Nocode - No Site</strong></p>
<p>I have been fascinated by computers ever since I first entered the internet via AOL-Chat through a 56k modem many many years ago.</p>
<p>In the early days of the web getting online was not that easy and creating a website meant actually digging into HTML, using an FTP-Client, and deciding on a webspace provider.</p>
<p>Fast forward 20+ years and you can now literally setup and host a website within minutes without having to worry about any of the above by using tools like <a href="https://carrd.co/">carrd</a>, <a href="https://www.webflow.com">webflow</a>, or any other website builder.</p>
<p>But, after working with several tools I often had the feeling they lacked some functionalities that I wanted.</p>
<p>With a tight indie-budget it is not always possible to buy the yearly paid plans and at some point I did not always want to have a branding on my projects if I am just having them run for some weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing about what&rsquo;s possible can save you money</strong></p>
<p>I was bullish on Nocode until some months ago. I have come to the conclusion that no-coders that do not at least look into basic web development concepts are not only missing out on valuable knowledge but also might have to pay a price for this knowledge gap.</p>
<p>Looking at the yearly subscription rates of some website builders this can easily get into the triple-digit yearly territory.</p>
<p>This does not mean that you always have to build things from the ground up, but rather having a better understanding of how things actually work in your Nocode tool.</p>
<p>This knowledge can help you make better decisions on what you are actually willing to pay for.</p>
<p><strong>Example carrd</strong></p>
<p>I love carrd. But it does not work for all projects. If you want to create a simple search engine-friendly blog it is really hard (or rather practically impossible) to create one that is useful in carrd.</p>
<p><a href="https://miniblog.carrd.co/">There are some tiny blog designs you can find</a>, but they lack SEO-friendliness and will most likely fail if you start writing real, longer blog-posts.</p>
<p>In addition, you need access to the meta tags, analytics, and further advanced options which means you will have to opt for the pro or pro plus plan, which comes at 19$ / 49$ per year.<br>
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think the price is fair for what you get. But carrd will not act as the website builder for all your needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/C02c4YR/carrd-price-screely.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/C02c4YR/carrd-price-screely.png"></p>
<p>If you already have a carrd pro plan with many projects and then need things carrd does not provide, you would switch to e.g. webflow and then again branding, or the CMS-Price plan which comes at 20/$ (16$ paid annualy).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ssW3rVy/webflow-price-screely.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/ssW3rVy/webflow-price-screely.png"></p>
<p>In addition all no-code tools offer you the opportunity to add custom code or have other optional snippets added.</p>
<p>And this knowledge can help you create websites that stand out, or just have fun little gimmicks.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Nocode is a great movement, that enables you to create fast. New tools and functionalities are coming up rather quick at the moment and I believe the market will become even more interesting in the next months <a href="https://www.makerpad.co/blog/the-future-of-no-code-2021-and-beyond">and years to come</a>.</p>
<p>Nocode does not mean you should not learn any code like basic web development concepts. Knowing about concepts like HTML, CSS brings you one step ahead of what some Nocode tool providers are planning for, which can give you more fleyibility and save you money.</p>
<p>You have the freedom to decide what you are willing to pay for and which tools you want to use for which goal.</p>
