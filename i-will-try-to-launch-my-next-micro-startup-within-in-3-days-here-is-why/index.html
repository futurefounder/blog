Alright, folks, we are right back at the start again.
This time for round #3 of the Micro Startup Journey.
I&rsquo;ve launched my first 2 Micro Startups in January and February and have taken the first days of March to reflect on what I have learned so far.
Time to launch
One main thing that struck me is - I launched both on nearly the same day of the month.">

<p>Alright, folks, we are right back at the start again.</p>
<p>This time for round #3 of the Micro Startup Journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve launched my first 2 Micro Startups in <a href="https://blog.futurefounder.me/one-micro-startup-per-month-1/">January</a> and <a href="https://blog.futurefounder.me/february-micro-startup/">February</a> and have taken the first days of March to reflect on what I have learned so far.</p>
<p><strong>Time to launch</strong></p>
<p>One main thing that struck me is - I launched both on nearly the same day of the month.</p>
<p>Close to the end.</p>
<p>At first, I thought &ldquo;<em>Fuck, it took me far too long to launch in February again</em>&rdquo;, but then I noticed a difference between the two.</p>
<p>With ViTAL I had been practically working on the project in November of 2020 when I started <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/startup-school-for-future-founders/">YC&rsquo;s Future Founder Program</a>.</p>
<p>So when I launched end of January it had been about 3 months.</p>
<p>With Vegan Book Base I went from idea to launch in about 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Frankly, I was delighted when I realized that I managed to improve my time to launch.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fkpyykP/ship-early-paul-graham.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/fkpyykP/ship-early-paul-graham.png"></p>
<p>Just as they <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/40-the-art-of-shipping-early-and-often">teach you at YC to ship early and well before you think you are ready</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What I expect from an early launch</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that it takes a lot of time to market and grow a Micro Startup.</p>
<p>This means just as development the feedback from users and adjustment of the product is also very important.</p>
<p>In this month I am hoping to have more time to adjust and react by having something out in the wild very early.</p>
<p>In the last months I also talked to potential users, had gotten feedback, and used that for my first product ideas.</p>
<p>But having something online quickly will actually speed up the whole process and in addition to the people I talk to I will have feedback from people over the world wide web which will increase the number of people telling me what&rsquo;s OK and what not.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The first Micro Startups have taught me a lot about <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">how to talk to potential clients</a> and how to actually ship things.</p>
<p>I want to try and be on the Startup field much faster this month and hope this increases my odds of getting valuable feedback I can then use to improve my Micro Startup with small but valuable steps.</p>
